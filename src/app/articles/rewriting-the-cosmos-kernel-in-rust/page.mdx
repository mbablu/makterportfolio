#Client: Multiple (including IESO, Internal Product Teams) 

#Role: UX/UI Designer & Accessibility Advocate 

#Duration: Ongoing (2016 – Present) 

###Context 

In large-scale, multi-stakeholder environments — especially across public and regulated industries — consistency, scalability, and accessibility are not just design preferences, they’re non-negotiable standards. 

As part of multiple transformation programs, I played a key role in contributing to and maintaining centralized Design Systems that enforced UX/UI consistency and WCAG-compliant accessibility across product portfolios. 

###Challenges 

Lack of consistent component usage across product teams

Accessibility violations and retroactive compliance efforts 

Multiple teams using ad hoc styling, fragmenting the 

UX Delays in dev handoff due to missing design specs and states 

###Goals 

Create a unified, reusable component system to reduce design/development duplication 

Embed accessibility into the design process—not treat it as a post-launch fix 

Improve cross-team collaboration and governance on design decisions 

Reduce friction between design, product, and engineering teams 

###My Process 

Audit & Gap Analysis 

Conducted an audit of existing UI components across different teams (State Farm + IESO) 

Mapped inconsistent elements and documented accessibility violations (e.g., poor contrast, missing labels) 

Reviewed screen reader compatibility for key flows 

Component Creation & Governance 

Designed accessible UI components in Figma, Sketch, and Adobe XD

Collaborated with front-end developers to translate designs into coded components 

Proposed new component additions to the central design system and got buy-in from core design teams 

Documentation & Handoff 

Created spec-ready documentation: spacing, states, interactions, accessibility notes (ARIA labels, tab order, contrast ratios) 

Provided annotated redlines and tokens to dev teams to reduce handoff ambiguity 

Training & Advocacy 

Led working sessions with product owners and devs to explain how to adopt and maintain accessibility best practices 

Participated in accessibility audits and retroactive fixes on legacy systems 

Promoted the use of inclusive language, accessible forms, and voice interaction patterns 

###Impact 

Unified multiple product teams under a single design language 

Reduced design inconsistencies by over 60% across platforms 

Eliminated redundant design effort by standardizing 30+ core components 

Increased WCAG compliance coverage from partial to near-full across multiple platforms 

Reduced dev handoff issues and rework due to complete, standardized specs Shape 

###Tools & Standards Design Tools: Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD, Illustrator 

Code & Handoff: Zeplin, Storybook, React libraries 

Accessibility: WCAG 2.1, WAI-ARIA, Screen Reader Testing (NVDA/VoiceOver), Contrast Checkers 

Collaboration: Jira, Confluence, Miro 

###Learnings & Reflections 

Creating and maintaining a scalable, accessible design system isn’t just about UI — it’s about culture, governance, and education. 

This initiative taught me how to: 

Be a translator between visual design and semantic code 

Integrate accessibility from day one rather than as a compliance patch 

Build alignment across silos by proving the value of systems thinking with real efficiency gains 

Design not only for aesthetics but for everyone, regardless of ability
