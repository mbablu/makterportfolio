## Context
The project was initiated by the Ontario Ministry of Energy to centralize and modernize the management of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) across the province—spanning solar, wind, microgrids, and battery systems.

## Challenge
Stakeholders held siloed data, priorities varied, and user access/control requirements conflicted. The system needed to be accessible, data-rich, and scalable—all while meeting the needs of highly diverse users (including those with disabilities).

## Goals 

Create a unified dashboard with role-based views and data visualization Ensure WCAG accessibility compliance from day one Prototype and test scalable workflows for DER control and monitoring 

## My Process 

User Research: 
Conducted interviews with multiple stakeholder groups 
Identified pain points in legacy systems and unmet needs 
Design Thinking Workshops: 
Ran ideation sessions with 4+ UX practitioners 
Created empathy maps, journey maps, and pain-gain visuals 

UX Artifacts: 
Wireframes, storyboards, interactive prototypes using Figma/Adobe XD 
Built modular components for a custom design library 

Agile Workflow: 
Worked in 2-week SAFe sprints 
Collaborated with product owners, developers, and QA in daily standups 
Presented design updates weekly to stakeholders, including CTO and VP Dev 

## Impact 

Delivered a new centralized design system used org-wide 
Enabled stakeholders to visualize energy data & control assets in real-time 
Significantly improved accessibility and system usability for all user types 
Laid UX groundwork for future smart grid integrations in Ontario
